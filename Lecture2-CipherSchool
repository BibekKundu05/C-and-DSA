This is the first program in this course
This program will print hello world

#include<iostream>      //Header file(input and output stream)

    cout<<"Hello world";    //This will print out Hello world on the user screen
    return 0;               //returning the output 0
}

/*
there are two stream in C++
1. input stream :- take input from user using cin function
2. output stream :- display output using cout function
return is use for output. Return 0 means output is 0.
displaying and output are not same, displaying is printing something.
In the code we return 0 because out main function is of integer data type.
